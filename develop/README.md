# Password-generator

Starting Javascript, I will implement the following user story: AS AN employee with access to sensitive data I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

First, to start creating variables for all requirements for a password such as the length, lowerCase, upperCase, Number, and specialCase characters.

Secondly, to start creating arrays per variable.

Thirdly, to start creating the function for generating the password.
